## Cross-Server Access

Starting with `v4.0`, you can access WGDashboards on other server through one WGDashboard with API Keys

### Desktop App

Since the major changes for `v4.0` is to move the whole front-end code to Vue.js. And with this change, we can take the
advantage of combining ElectronJS and Vue.js to create a Desktop version of WGDashboard. Currently, we provide an Universal macOS app and a Windows app.

To download the app, please visit the [latest release](https://github.com/donaldzou/WGDashboard/releases).
