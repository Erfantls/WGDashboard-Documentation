# v2.2

- 🎉  **New Features**
	- **Add new peers**: Now you can add peers directly on dashboard, it will generate a pair of private key and public key. You can also set its DNS, endpoint allowed IPs. Both can set a default value in the setting page. [❤️ in [#44](https://github.com/donaldzou/wireguard-dashboard/issues/44)]
	- **QR Code:** You can add the private key in peer setting of your existed peer to create a QR code. Or just create a new one, dashboard will now be able to auto generate a private key and public key ;) Don't worry, all keys will be generated on your machine, and **will delete all key files after they got generated**. [❤️ in [#29](https://github.com/donaldzou/wireguard-dashboard/issues/29)]
	- **Peer configuration file download:** Same as QR code, you now can download the peer configuration file, so you don't need to manually input all the details on the peer machine! [❤️ in [#40](https://github.com/donaldzou/wireguard-dashboard/issues/40)]
	- **Search peers**: You can now search peers by their name.
	- **Autostart on boot:** Added a tutorial on how to start the dashboard to on boot! Please read the [tutorial below](🪜-Usage.md). [❤️ in [#29](https://github.com/donaldzou/wireguard-dashboard/issues/29)]
