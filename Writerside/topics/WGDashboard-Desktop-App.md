# WGDashboard Desktop App

Since the major changes for `v4.0` is to move the whole front-end code to Vue.js. And with this change, we can take the
advantage of combining ElectronJS and Vue.js to create a Desktop version of WGDashboard. 

Currently, we provide a Universal macOS app and a Windows app.

To download the app, please visit the [latest release](https://github.com/WGDashboard/WGDashboard/releases).
